Scrapy Intro Talk
=================

Treat this as a complimentary to the Scrapy [tutorial][1] with good practices
in mind.

There are 2 things involved in a scraping project:

- scraping
- crawling

There are 2 examples in this repo that demonstrates how Scrapy solves the
those things. The scripts are aptly named ;)

These are the relevant topics in the official Scrapy documentation that are
used in the examples to help with your study:

- [Requests and Responses][3]
- [Selectors][8]
- [Items][4]
- [ItemLoaders][5]
- [CrawlSpider][6]
- [LinkExtractors][7]

This was given as a tech talk for [Python.PH][2] November 2016 Meetup.
